Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing areas of computer science. The applications of Machine Learning are reshaping society, from consumer products (e.g., voice assistants and recommendations) to life-sciences (e.g., personalized medicine and tumor detection). This course will build on the Data Science introductory course, and help students understand how, why and when machine learning methods work. \n\nStudents will be introduced to major paradigms in machine learning, and gain working knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Students will learn to solve common problems such as regression, classification, clustering, matrix completion and pattern recognition. They will learn how to train and optimize neural networks.  They will explore modern software libraries that enable programmers to develop machine learning systems. Students will use these libraries along with publicly available data sets to build models, then learn how to evaluate and verify the results. Throughout the course, as they apply technical methods, students will also examine the societal context of machine learning and considerations of transparency, bias and privacy.  \n\nCourse assignments will consist of short programming exercises and peer discussions of ethical considerations.

A typical end result is a prototype of or a fully functional software system ready for use by the clients. These projects are completed by teams of 4-6 students, who meet with the client weekly to share progress and get feedback. \n\nStudents complete online modules under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Pre-work includes instruction in communication, goal-setting, and professional development. During the industry experience, students submit written reflections on their personal goals, challenges, and, for the studio, team feedback.
